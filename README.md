# swampers-themes
My theme/template collection

My theme and template layouts. Most will be designed in and meant to be used in my boot-build app.

## Themes

This repo can and will vary greatly. These files are actively developed from scratch.

## Motivation

- Whatever I can come up with at the minute.

## Installation

Delete the files in /src/styles/ and /src/scripts/ then drop these in the '/src' directory in boot-build. Overwrite index.html of course.

## To Do

- LOL!!! Sounds better.
